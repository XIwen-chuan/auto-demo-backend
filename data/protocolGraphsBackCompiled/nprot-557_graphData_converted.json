Incubate protein-DNA complexes at ambient temperature (for the experiments described here, 21-23 Celsius) for 30 minutes prior to measurements. Measure anisotropy using a Safire (Tecan Group Ltd.) fluorescent plate reader. Determine G-factor by measuring 1:1 complexes of each protein bound to its respective fluorophore-labeled substrate at the highest protein concentration and polarization calculations are adjusted accordingly using the instrument\u2019s software (XFluor). Perform all anisotropy measurements in triplicate and perform comparable measurements using proteins from different purification batches.",

Allow the reactions to come to equilibrium by incubation at ambient temperature for 60 minutes. Plot data as change in anisotropy versus the concentration of added ligand, homoduplex DNA (low affinity). (Figure 2) Fit the dissociation curve to a 3-parameter hyperbolic decay curve with Sigmaplot. Use the resulting EC50 to calculate the Ki using the following equation: Ki=EC50/ (1+[s])/kd, where [S] is the concentration of the fluorescein-labeled DNA, Kd is for MSH2MSH3 binding to (CA)4-loop DNA (high affinity). The resulting Ki, then, yields an indirect estimate of Kd for a low affinity substrate, since saturation with protein would not have been feasible by direct association",
