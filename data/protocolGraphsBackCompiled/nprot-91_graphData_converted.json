Glycine can be identified according to its small C\u03b1 chemical shift, and sometimes two H\u03b1 peaks.

For threonine, valine, isoleucine and leucine, classification can be easily done based on their characteristic side chain chemical shifts. In particular, the methyl groups of these residues always give rise to well resolved TOCSY correlations with other 13C spins. Some serine, lysine, arginine, and proline can be distinguished, provided that the C\u03b2H\u03b2 spin-pair for serine, C\u03b2H\u03b2, C\u03b3H\u03b3 and C\u03b4H\u03b4 spin-pairs for lysine, arginine and proline can be identified.
