Sample the output voltage signal of the microphone and cut the time trace into N time windows of length T. To obtain a frequency spectrum with a resolution, \u0394f, of 1 Hz, the length of each time window, T = 1/\u0394f, should be set to 1 s and the sampling frequency, f[S] = N[S]/T, should be 4096 or 8192 Hz, corresponding to a number of samples, N[S], of 212 and 213, respectively. Choosing N[S] to be a power of two makes it possible to apply Fast Fourier transformation (FFT analysis is implemented in many software packages, including the analysis software that comes with the PSV laser Doppler vibrometer). Determine the Fourier amplitude of the voltage signal at the stimulus frequency (1kHz).",

Sample the output signals of both microphones and subject them to Fast Fourier transforms (see step 1). Determine the respective Fourier amplitudes at 1 kHz. Assume that the amplitude obtained for the pressure microphone is 50 mV, and that the calibration at 94 dB SPL (step 1) yielded an amplitude of 100 mV. The sound pressure corresponding to the 50 mV output is then calculated as 94 dB SPL + 20 log (50/100) = 88 dB SPL. Acoustic power per unit area is the product of the pressure, p, and the particle velocity, u, in the sound wave (under far field conditions), whereby a power of 0 dB (= 10\u201312 W m\u20132) is equivalent to p = 2 x 10\u20135 N m-2 and u = 5 x 10-8 m s-1. In the far field, the pressure p is proportional to the particle velocity u, so a pressure of 88 dB SPL corresponds to a particle velocity of 5 x 10-8 m s\u20131 x 1088/20 \u2248 1.3 mm s\u20131, providing a calibration factor for converting the voltage output of the reference microphone into particle velocities. The calibration should be performed for different stimulus intensities and frequencies to assay the intensity and the frequency characteristics of the reference microphone.",
