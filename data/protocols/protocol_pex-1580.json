            "content": "<p>Developing<strong> </strong>protein-based imaging tools for monitoring the dynamics of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in living cell is necessary to understand kinase activities. Genetically-encoded biosensors based on FRET (FRET biosensors) have been widely used to dynamically monitor the activity of PTKs in living cells with high spatiotemporal resolution <sup>1,2</sup>. The typical design of these FRET biosensors consists of two parts <sup>3</sup>: a pair of fluorescent proteins for FRET action, and a sensing region (e.g. a ligand region (SH2 domain) and a substrate peptide containing a tyrosine phosphorylation site). A flexible linker peptide is also used to connect each domain. However, the limitation in sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range of biosensors have hindered their broader applications <sup>4,5</sup>. Several research groups have developed FRET biosensors <sup>2,6,7</sup>, but the general procedure for constructing FRET biosensors still involves trial and error. Thus, a more efficient method which allows for selection of biosensors with better performance in response to the PTK activity from a large number of biosensor variants is required.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, we introduced a systematic method to optimize the FRET biosensors for Fyn kinase directly in mammalian cell through function-based screening, which combines the advantages of several technologies, such as site-saturation mutagenesis, mammalian cell library, and high-throughput DNA sequencing. We also developed mammalian cell-based and function-based high-throughput screening by FACS to directly optimize the Fyn FRET biosensors for studying the activity of Fyn kinase. Because the FRET efficiency of intramolecular biosensors is primarily influenced by the distance and the relative orientation of the two fluorophores <sup>2</sup>, we chose to optimize the substrate sequence in the sensing region of FRET biosensors (ECFP/YPet pair) to increase sensitivity, specificity, and FRET dynamic range in reporting kinase activities. The step-by-step protocol for the Fyn FRET biosensor development is described.</p>"

The frequency of a single variant can then be compared between groups in calculating an enrichment ratio <sup>9</sup>. The enrichment ratio, <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub>, for any single variant, <em>v</em>, is calculated by dividing the frequency of the variant from the selected library, <em>f</em><sub><em>v,sorted</em></sub>, over that from the input control, <em>f</em><sub><em>v,input</em></sub>, according to <em>E</em><sub><em>v </em></sub><em>= f</em><sub><em>v,sorted</em></sub><em> / f</em><sub><em>v,input </em></sub>(Equation 2).</p><p>6)  The criteria for selecting a biosensor with better performance is that the variants with <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub> &gt; 1 in KAH and KDL groups and &lt; 1 in KAL and KDH groups.</p><p>7)  The data for each substrate sequence can be also visualized in the 4D plot using Matlab software. To achieve better illustration of the 4D-plot, <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub><em> </em>of each group can be further normalized to <em>E</em><sub><em>vn</em></sub> by <em>E</em><sub><em>vn</em></sub> = log (<em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub>) when <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub>\uff1e1, and <em>E</em><sub><em>vn</em></sub> = <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em>-1</sub> when <em>E</em><sub><em>v </em></sub>\u2264 1. These selected sequences with 4D analysis will be further evaluated by their product of <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub> (KAH) and <em>E</em><sub><em>v</em></sub> (KDL) and calibrated with the product of WT biosensor to filter and identify biosensors with the best performance.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>7.

However, the limitation in sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range of FRET biosensors have hindered their broader applications. Here, we introduced a systematic platform, FRET-Seq, which integrates high-throughput FRET sorting and next-generation sequencing, to identify FRET biosensors with better performance from large-scale libraries directly in mammalian cells. </p><p><br></p>",
