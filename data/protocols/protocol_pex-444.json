Proteoform analysis is nowadays of crucial importance since they have been proven to have a key role in biological systems [<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmic.201300432\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>] [<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/778\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>]. This includes both precise determination of the expressed sequence of the protein and the characterization of all Post Translational Modifications (PTM), in particular their precise localization and determination of their combination (combinatorial PTM). Several proteomics strategies, including bottom-up, middle-down and top-down proteomics, have been developed to analyze the PTM at the peptide level or to directly target proteoforms. Nevertheless, there is a lack of bioinformatics tools able to combine such proteomics results and it is still difficult to map the PTMs identified in bottom-up data onto proteoforms obtained by top-down proteomics.</p><p>In this protocol, we describe the key steps for using <strong>ProteoCombiner</strong>, a powerful tool capable of integrating proteomics datasets obtained from different experiments (bottom-up and top-down proteomics) and different search engines, such as, PatternLab for Proteomics[<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2015.133\" target=\"_blank\">4</a>], MaxQuant[<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr101065j\" target=\"_blank\">5</a>], Comet[<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmic.201200439\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>], ProsightPD[<a href=\"https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/0471250953.bi1306s19\" target=\"_blank\">7</a>], pTop[<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03963\" target=\"_blank\">8</a>] and TopPIC[<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/22/3495/2525589\" target=\"_blank\">9</a>], in order to increase the confidence of proteoform identification and facilitate the characterization of PTMs. A video demonstrating ProteoCombiner v1.0 in action is available at <a href=\"https://proteocombiner.pasteur.fr/video\" target=\"_blank\">https://proteocombiner.pasteur.fr/video</a>.</p>"

Our tool also provides a rapid and easy visualization, manual validation and comparison of the identified proteoform sequences, including post-translational modifications (PTM) characterization. Thus, ProteoCombiner is recommended for studies dealing with different proteomics strategies, in order to increase confidence in proteoform identification including PTMs.</p>",
