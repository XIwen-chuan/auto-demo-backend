            "content": "<p>After 50 years of Moore\u2019s law, it\u2019s now possible to pack nearly 1 million transistors in the space of a paramecium. This radical miniaturization of electronics has brought with it incredible opportunities for the field of microrobotics. In principle, electronic components could be appropriated to create tiny robots that sense their environment, communicate, or compute.</p><p><br></p><p>But a major roadblock exists: there is no micron-scale actuator system that seamlessly integrates with semiconductor processing and responds to standard electronic control signals.&nbsp;In a companion publication, we showed how to overcome this barrier with a new class of voltage-controllable electrochemical actuators that operate at low voltages (200 mV), low power (10 nW), and are completely compatible with silicon processing.&nbsp;To demonstrate their potential, we created lithographic fabrication and release protocols and prototyped sub-hundred micrometer walking robots.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This document provides a detailed description of the steps we used to build electronically integrated, microscopic robots. Every step is performed massively in parallel, allowing us to produce over one million robots per 4-inch wafer.&nbsp;Looking forward, these results can be built upon to incorporate more complex electronic components, taking a major step toward mass-manufactured, silicon-based, functional robots too small to be resolved by the naked eye.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>We have developed a fabrication process that can be used to build millions of microscopic, electronically-integrated robots. Our procedure includes steps for building silicon microelectronics, building components for actuation, encapsulation steps, and a process for releasing the robots into aqueous environments. Each step is carried out massively in parallel, allowing us to build over a million robots on a single 4-inch wafer. Broadly, the new actuators and fabrication protocols presented here offer a generic platform and can be used to make a wide range of silicon-based, functional robotic systems that are too small to be resolved by the naked eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
