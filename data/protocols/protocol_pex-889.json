            "content": "<p>Development of skin requires crosstalk between epidermal and dermal layers to mature and produce appendages, such as hair follicles and glands. Over several decades, there have been studies modeling human skin using epidermal and dermal cells in vitro; however, generating appendages together with the skin remains an unmet challenge<sup>1-3</sup>. In our previously published human inner ear generation method, we observed epithelial cyst formation as a byproduct of inner ear organoid induction<sup>4</sup>. Moreover, we were able to generate hairy-skin organoids from similar epithelial cysts in mouse pluripotent stem cell 3D cultures<sup>5</sup>. Here, we devised a new differentiation strategy using chemically-defined basal medium and carefully timed TGF, BMP, and FGF signaling pathway modulation to co-induce epidermal and dermal cells from human pluripotent stem cells<sup>6</sup>. The resulting organoids are composed of epidermal, dermal, and neuro-glial cells and produce hair follicles after approximately 70 days in culture. In addition, melanocytes, sebaceous glands, dermal adipocytes, Merkel cells, and sensory neurons are observed within one skin organoid unit. Skin organoids can be maintained for up to 5 months in culture using this protocol. </p>"

After ~70 days of differentiation, hair follicle germs should form that are visible using low magnification brightfield imaging (4x or 10x magnification). From days ~70-150 of differentiation, hair follicles will elongate and become pigmented. This skin organoid system should be a suitable model for studying the development of human skin and its accessory tissues and skin-related diseases.

Here, we describe a three-dimensional organoid culture system that can generate fully stratified skin with its appendages from human pluripotent stem cells. This <em>in vitro</em>-based skin organoid culture system will benefit investigations into basic skin biology and disease modeling, as well as translational efforts to reconstruct or regenerate skin tissue.</p>",
