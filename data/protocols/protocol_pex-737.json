In the original work a GFP lentiviral construct was used to mark the producing cells, however any other cell-retained marker can be used.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lentivirus production </strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Plate 293FT (mycoplasma free) cells in P100 plates (10 cm Petri dishes).</p><p>Transfect the cells when they are about 80% confluent.</p><p>Change the media 30 min to 3 h before the transfection (add 9 ml of fresh DMEM media plus 10% FBS plus Penicillin/Streptomycin).</p><p>Prepare the transfection solution A (Lentiviral plasmid (either sLP-Cherry or GFP plasmid) 10 ug, pCMV-dR8.2 plasmid 6.5 ug, pCMV-VSV-G plasmid 3.5 ug, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2M 62 uL; up to 500 ul with water).</p><p>Prepare the transfection solution B (2x HEPES buffered saline 500 ul) and slowly add the solution A to B. Mix and leave at room temperature for 15 min.</p><p>Add the A/B mixed solution to the 293FT cells drop by drop (1 ml per P100 plate).</p><p>18 h after the transfection wash 2X with PBS and add 6 ml of fresh medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin).</p><p>1<sup>st</sup> virus collection (48 h after the transfection): collect medium from the plates (and add 6 ml of fresh medium for the next day collection); spin 5 min at 1200 rpm at 4 degrees; filter the supernatant through 0.45 uM filters; aliquot and store at -80 degrees.</p><p>2<sup>nd</sup> virus collection (72 h after the transfection): same as described in step 9.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: if required, the virus supernatant can be ultracentrifuged to obtain a higher viral titre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lentiviral infection of 4T1 cells</strong></p><p>1. Plate 75,000 4T1 cells per well in a 6-well-plate.</p><p>2. The day after, infect the cells by adding the same amount of supernatant (or concentrated viruses) containing sLP-Cherry and GFP lentiviral particles plus polybrene 8 ug/ml and leave them in incubator overnight.</p><p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>: a) the optimal amount of virus to use depends on the quality of each preparation; therefore, every virus preparation should be tested and titre in advance; b) polybrene can be toxic to some cell lines, in that case it should be avoided.</p><p>3. Wash 2X with PBS and add fresh media.</p><p>4.&nbsp;<u>Three days after the infection</u>, collect your cells and isolate the high expressing mCherry-GFP double positive cells by FACS.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: if you sort your infected cells later than 3 days after the infection, you may collect cells that are mCherry+ because they are uptaking the mCherry and not because they have been infected with the sLP-Cherry virus.</p><p>5.

Culture with conditioned media (CM) </strong></p><p>(Note: this assay will be less efficient, cells might be labelling in the co-culture test, but show poor labelling by supernatant transfer, this will depend on the general secretion level of the specific cell type)</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plate Labelling-4T1 cells in a P100.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cells are 80% confluent add 10 ml of fresh medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect CM after 48 h in culture.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin 10 min at 750 rpm at 4 degrees.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect the supernatant and spin 10 min at 2500 rpm at 4 degrees.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect the supernatant: this is the CM ready-to-use.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 8 ml of CM to recipient cells (50,000 cells per well on a 6-well plate, seeded the day before). 293T, 4T1 or other cell lines of interest can be used as recipient.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect the recipient cells 48 h after and check for mCherry uptake by FACS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uptake <em>in vivo </em>by FACS</strong></p><p>Note: different tissues will have different levels of autofluorescence, the guide below is referred to the lungs.</p><p>1.   Inject 100,000-1,000,000 Labelling 4T1 cells intravenously in Balb/c mice.</p><p>2.  Collect the lungs and process them as indicated in the methods of <em>Ombrato et al., Nature 2019</em>.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify by FACS labelled tissue cells by using a mCherry-vs-GFP gate (as shown in Fig. 1f, <em>Ombrato et al., Nature 2019</em>). Use FMOs control stainings to exclude autofluorescent cells (usually on the diagonal in the gate) from mCherry+ cells.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: some cells could specifically lose the cell-retained marker (such as GFP) <em>in vivo</em>. In this case, the mCherry+GFP- gate should be lowered to exclude the highest mCherry+ cells: by doing this, potential tumour cells will be excluded (the majority of labelled tissue cells uptaking the sLP-Cherry are not as bright as the Labelling-4T1 cells).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uptake <em>in vitro / in vivo </em>by Immunofluorescence</strong></p><p>Upon uptake, the sLP-Cherry mostly localizes in vesicular structures. When permeabilising, the up-taken protein will be in part lost.</p><p>To overcome this issue, you may consider different options when performing immunofluorescence:</p><p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stain live cells or live tissue sections by using membrane markers to avoid permeabilisation with detergents;</p><p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where intracellular staining is required, isolate the cells of interest by FACS (discriminating mCherry+ and mCherry- cells) and stain them after sorting.</p><p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test multiple detergents to test if some are better in retaining the up-taken fluorescent signal.</p>"
