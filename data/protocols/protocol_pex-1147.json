      "content": "Lipid mediators play a central role in the regulation of a whole range of biological functions in both in humans and experimental systems <sup>1, 2, 3, 4</sup>. These molecules are produced in a range of organs and tissues at concentrations that are commensurate with their biological actions, which in large part are dictated by the affinity of these molecules to their cognate receptors. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) represents a robust and highly sensitive approach for both the identification and quantitation of these potent autacoids since chromatography allows for the separation of isobaric molecules as well as double bond and chiral isomers. Mass spectrometry captures information on the fragmentation profile of the molecules of interest, which coupled with the retention time of the molecule in liquid chromatography provides a fingerprint for the identification of these molecules. In addition, LC-MS/MS allows for the simultaneous monitoring of tens and sometimes hundreds of molecules providing a snapshot of a number of dynamic pathways and the flux down each of these bioactive pathways.&nbsp;Herein, we shall review the protocols employed to obtain a snapshot of the dynamic pathways for the four major bioactive metabolomes that include the arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid metabolomes <sup>5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12</sup>. These approaches help providing insights into mechanisms activated during inflammation as well as new leads into underlying causes of disease by measuring the flux down each of the major bioactive metabolomes <sup>5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</sup>. Given that the production and many of the biological actions of these mediators are conserved throughout evolution, these methodologies are applicable to biological material from experimental systems such as tunicates <sup>13</sup>, mice <sup>5, 7</sup> and baboons <sup>9</sup> as well as humans <sup>6, 8, 11, 14, 15</sup>. Thus, these methodologies facilitate the direct translation of findings made in experimental systems to humans and <em>vice versa</em>.</p><p><br></p>"

Due to the relatively low concentration of these molecules in biological samples, this methodology is classically coupled with solid phase extraction (SPE) techniques that enhance the sensitivity of the assay. Herein, we provide a step-by-step description of instrumentation employed in the both SPE and LC-MS/MS and detailed methodologies employed in the extraction of these lipid mediators and their identification and quantitation using LC-MS/MS.</p><p><br></p>",
