Place flasks in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37 <sup>o</sup>C).</p><p>OPTIONAL : Check cell viability by adding trypan blue to some cells on a microscope slide.&nbsp;About 50% or more of the cells should exclude the dye.</p><p><br></p><p><u>DAY 2</u>:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check cultures under the microscope to determine if cells have attached to the plastic.&nbsp;</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any floating cells did not survive the freeze/thaw process.&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the media and replace with 15 mL of fresh BEGM.&nbsp;</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will remove the dead cells and any left-over DMSO if cells were added directly to the flask without a prior rinse.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place flasks back into the incubator.</p><p><u>DAY 4 and LATER</u>:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate media and replace with 18 mL of BEGM.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace media every two days.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cells reach approximately 80-100% confluence, passage cells into more T75 flasks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Passage Protocol:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate off media.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 4 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution (room temperature) to each T75 flask.&nbsp;Incubate at 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 2-3 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approximately 80-90% of the cells are detached (which can be facilitated by tapping sides and bottom of the flask), add a half volume of SBTI to the flask, pipet up the trypsin/SBTI mixture, and rinse the flask bottom.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aids mixing of the trypsin and SBTI, and helps remove some of the still adherent cells.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the cells to a sterile centrifuge tube.&nbsp;Cells from individual flasks can be combined.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centrifuge cells at 1000 RPM for five minutes at room temperature.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate off the supernatant.&nbsp;Agitate the pellet by tapping to break up the pellet.&nbsp;Add 10 mL BEGM, and vigorously and quickly pipet the cells to create a homogeneous suspension.&nbsp;</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer a 10 \u03bcL aliquot to a hemocytometer and count the cells.&nbsp;A confluent T75 flask typically has 2-4 million cells.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/T75 flask.&nbsp;Final volume of BEGM should be 18ml/flask.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPTIONAL: Additionally, some cells can be set aside for cryopreservation at this point. (See below).</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture cells as above, changing the media every two days until cells reach confluence.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When flasks reach confluence: 1) cryopreserve the cells, 2) transfer to Transwells or other plastic ware for studies, and/or 3) further passage cells.</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cells have been removed by trypsin, the trypsin neutralized with SBTI, and cells are counted, adjust cell density to the desired one by either adding more media and/or centrifuging and re-suspending in less media.&nbsp;Usually we adjust the density to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml.</p><p><strong><em>For Transwells</em></strong>:</p><p>Determine the number of inserts to be seeded and adjust cell density and volume as outlined in the table below:</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Suggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes are given in Table 1</em></p><p><br></p><p>Example:&nbsp;seed twelve 24 mm inserts at 300,000 cells per insert.&nbsp;Include a fudge factor so you do not run out of cells.&nbsp;In this case, calculate as if you were seeding 14 inserts.</p><p>Fourteen x .75 mL = 10.5 mL final volume.&nbsp;Fourteen x 300,000 cells = 4.2 million cells.</p><p>If your cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 million/ml, you would add 4.2 mL of the cell suspension to 6.3 mL of additional medium to get the desired plating density.
