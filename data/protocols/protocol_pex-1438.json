            "content": "<p>High throughput sequencing of amplified marker gene sequences (barcodes) is a simple and rapid method of assessing the taxonomic composition of a complex microbial community. The \u201cmeta-barcoding\u201d approach is often based on amplification of one or more variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, however, this target often fails to provide species level resolution. The cpn60 gene (also known as groEL or hsp60) contains a 552-558 bp variable region (the cpn60 \u201cuniversal target\u201d) that can be amplified with \u201cuniversal\u201d PCR primers and this sequence has been demonstrated to meet the criteria as a barcode for Bacteria&nbsp;[1]. The sequence provides species level resolution and has been shown to be a good predictor of whole genome sequence similarities&nbsp;[2\u20136]. Since cpn60 is conserved in Bacteria, Eukaryotes and some Archaea, cpn60 barcode sequencing can be used for simultaneous detection of multiple Domains of life&nbsp;[7]. A public database of cpn60 sequences, cpnDB (www.cpndb.ca), facilitates the identification of cpn60 barcode sequences&nbsp;[8]. As a result of these features, cpn60 meta-barcode sequencing has been applied to the characterization of a wide variety of host-associated and environmental microbiomes&nbsp;[7, 9\u201314].</p><p><br></p><p>Amplicon sequencing methods are subject to a variety of sources of bias, including amplification primer bias. To minimize this effect of cpn60 amplification, we developed a primer \u201ccocktail\u201d approach to ensure amplification of cpn60 sequences from genomes with a wide range of G+C content&nbsp;[15]. Use of a single annealing temperature of&nbsp;60&nbsp;\u00b0C&nbsp;is appropriate for most samples, although practitioners may want to consider pooling PCR products produced across an annealing temperature gradient in some situations&nbsp;[16].</p><p><br></p><p>The protocol presented here is a modification of the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation (Part #15044223)&nbsp;[17]&nbsp;and describes the production of cpn60 amplicon libraries for sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The length of the amplicon prevents assembly of complete barcode sequences, but we have shown that as little as 150 bp from the 5\u2019 end of the barcode sequence is generally sufficient for species level identification&nbsp;[18]. We routinely use a 500 cycle sequencing kit but run it as 401x101 rather than 251x251 and use only the Read 1 sequences in downstream analysis.</p>"

The cpn60 gene (also known as groEL, hsp60) is present in almost all bacteria and a 552-558 bp region of the gene has been established as a barcode for species level identification of bacteria. The primer cocktail used in this protocol amplifies cpn60 barcode sequences from bacteria with a wide range of G+C content. Some species of&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma</em>&nbsp;lack the cpn60 gene and therefore this method is not recommended to detect&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma</em>. DNA sequences generated from this method could be compared to cpnDB, a public database of cpn60 sequences, for identification. Library preparation involves cpn60 amplicon generation, PCR clean-up, index PCR, index PCR clean-up, library quantification, normalization, pooling, library denaturation and loading. Time taken to complete depends on the number of samples included. If using 96 samples, the procedure takes 8 hours but there are several stages where the samples could be stored and continued the next day. Specific instructions are provided for the Illumina MiSeq platform, but the protocol could easily be adapted for other sequencing platforms.</p>",
